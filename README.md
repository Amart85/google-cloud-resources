# :zap: Google Cloud Resources

* Information on Google Associate Cloud Engineer(ACE) & Professional Data Engineer (PDE) Certifications.
* Note: a lot of the links below are 2 years old so it is important to check the latest exam list of subjects. In my experience there is a large body of fundamentals that do not change
* I took the ACE exam online at home and passed first time but it took a lot of preparation time.
* See Google exam guidelines and be prepared - you need to clear a room and must concentrate for about 2.5 hours (there is the 2-hour exam + waiting time + pre-exam setup and a post-exam feedback questionnaire - a long time without a pee). You will need to film the room for the examiners so they can see there are no notes stuck to the celing etc. And you cannot look away from the screen as your camera will be monitoring your eye-movements.
* **Check your wifi UPLOAD speed (i.e. not just your download speed)**. Recommended minimum of 1.0 Mbps upload / 1.0 Mbps download)- [Kryterion have an online test](https://www.kryteriononline.com/systemcheck/) you can do. I actually had to pay a fee to reschedule my exam when I realised on the exam day that my internet upload speed was not enough - don't do this.
* I was informed that I passed right after the exam, although they do not tell you how many questions you got right. In about a week I got an official email notification that I was certified.
* **Note** certification lasts for 2 years, after which a recertification exam is required.
